# Scrabble
_Scrabble_ is a lightweight module that lets you cheat on a wide range of word games, most notably, the eponymous. Pass your letters into _Scrabble_ as a string and it will return an array of all the possible combinations of those letters that comprise words in the English Dictionary. _Scrabble_ is also useful for "Words with Friends," and other popular iOS and Android apps.
